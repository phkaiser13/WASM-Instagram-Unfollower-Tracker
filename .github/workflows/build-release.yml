# * release process for the Rust WASM module. It triggers on pushes/PRs to the
# * main branch for continuous integration, and on version tags (e.g., v1.0.0)
# * to create a GitHub Release with the compiled WASM artifacts. It uses
# * best practices like caching, linting (clippy), and job separation.
